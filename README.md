# Blackjack-Game

Created a blackjack game from scratch using Python. As of yet, doesn't require extra libraries to run.
In it, I tried to add multiple rules and scenarios to best replicate the actual game:
- Splitting Pairs
- Doubling Down
- Insurance
- Natural Blackjacks

Upcoming features:
- Betting for fun aspect
- Pygame for visual aspects
